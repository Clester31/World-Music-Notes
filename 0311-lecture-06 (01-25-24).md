## Texture and Form

* Texture - The relative density and kinds of interaction between soudns
* Form - Large scale musical organization

### Texture

* Monophonic Texture (monophony)
  * 1 Melodic Line
* Polyphonic texture (polyphone)
  * 2 or more lines
 * Harmonized textures ("hoorhythm")

 * Polyphony
   * Chords + Melody
   * Chords - Any sounds that is a combination of two or more tones

 * Multiple Melody textures (endless varieties)
   * Central Javanese Gamelan
   * Bambuti song of central africa
  
#### Review of Basic Textures

* Monophonic - anything with only 1 melodic line
* Polyphonc - Pretty much anything else
  * Harmonized textures
  * Homorhythm
  * Chords + Melody
  * Multiple Melody Textures
 
### Other Aspects of Texture 

* Ployrhythm
  * Simultaneous contrastic rhythms
 
* Interlocking Textures
  * Single melody (and/or rhythm) divided among multiple performers 

* Call and Response
  * Also referred to as "antiphonal" textures
    * Often solo "caller" and group "response"
   
## Form

* How music progresses from beginning to end
* Formal possibilities:
  * Distinct sections (verse-chorus)
  * Based on melodic and/or rhythm phrases (AABB)
  * Based on a harmonic progression (chord sequence)
  * Repetition (Cyclic forms)
  * Rhythmic athemcatical ... something
 
### Ostinato Based Forms

* These forms are based on a single, repeating musical figure called an ostinato

### Cyclic FOrms

* Forms that consist of one or more cycles that are repeated over and over
  * Gamelan Music (cycles marked by gong strokes)
  * Blues music (marked by a specific chord progression - 12 bar blues)
